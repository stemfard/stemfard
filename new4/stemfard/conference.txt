StemfardCon: Conference on Pedagogical and Reproducible Computational Methods
StemfardCon is an academic conference focused on pedagogical and reproducible 
approaches to teaching and learning computational STEM techniques using 
step-wise execution frameworks.

STEMSteps Conf provides an academic forum for educators and students to share 
reproducible, step-wise approaches to teaching computational STEM techniques, 
emphasizing transparency, pedagogy, and executable reasoning.

Primary Themes

Initial Value Problems (IVPs)

Interpolation and Approximation

Linear and Nonlinear Regression

Iterative Techniques for Numerical Computation

Error Analysis and Convergence

Algorithmic Transparency in STEM Education

Methodological Focus

Step-wise execution and inspectable reasoning

Teaching with intermediate computational states

2. How to Announce the Award

Early in the conference:

“At the end of the day, we will award a laptop to the participant who demonstrates exceptional engagement or creative use of the API.”

Keep reminding participants subtly during demos or workshops.

At the closing session:

Show a certificate or trophy alongside the laptop.

Give a short citation of achievement, e.g.:

“For demonstrating outstanding engagement, creativity, and pedagogical insight using the STEMSteps API.”
